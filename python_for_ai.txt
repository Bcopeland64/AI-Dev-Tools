Python for AI
Applied NLP & Knowledge Systems: RAG, Semantic AI and Secure
Deployment
LevelUp Economy and Istidama Consulting are pleased to present the 16-week integrated training
program customized to prepare learners with the technical, English language, and professional skills
needed for today’s AI-driven workplace.
The program brings together three strands:
●​ Technical Track (16 weeks, ~160 hrs): From Python and data foundations through NLP, RAG
systems, Knowledge Graphs, and deployment, leading to a Capstone project.
●​ English for AI (16 weeks, ~80 hrs): Professional English anchored in AI, with authentic
readings, technical reporting, and oral presentations.
●​ Soft Skills Program (5 weeks, 20 hrs): Focused workshops on communication, teamwork,
problem-solving, and workplace readiness.
The delivery model is hybrid, combining synchronous and asynchronous online components with
weekly in-person labs, workshops, and project sessions.

Program Overview
The program is structured to balance challenge with support. Learner progress will be monitored
throughout, with weekly deliverables, project milestones, and formative assessments built into each
track. Learners who need additional help will receive targeted support, and they will also be given
the agency to seek help on their own through structured TA “office hours”. These office hours give
students the chance to clarify technical or language challenges, get feedback on assignments, or ask
for guidance on projects — ensuring no one is left behind while reinforcing responsibility for their
own learning.

Distinguishing Features
●​ Automated Pre-Testing: All learners complete proctored entry tests in English and
Python to establish baseline skills.
●​ Weekly formative exercises to ensure practical application of skills covered under each
topic.
●​ Authentic Resources: Course content draws on real AI texts and media: Demystifying
Artificial Intelligence, Interpretable Machine Learning, articles from WIRED and MIT
Technology Review, and multimedia such as Talks at Google with Dr. Omar Hatamleh
(NASA).
●​ Capstone Project: Learners design, build, and present an end-to-end AI system in teams.
Example themes include:
○​ Defense: RAG-powered Q&A over synthetic defense policy documents.
○​ Infrastructure: KG-enhanced entity linking for smart city data (traffic, outages).
○​ Healthcare:

Retrieval

and

summarization

across

multilingual

health

texts

(Arabic/English).
○​ Education: Semantic search across course materials, linked to curriculum ontologies.​
(Teams may also propose their own ideas.)
●​ Hybrid Delivery: A blend of live instruction, self-paced practice, offline labs, and project
work.
●​ Competency-Based Outcomes: Each module ends with a deliverable (repo, report,
presentation) and a defined skills outcome.

Design Principles
●​ Integrated Pathways: Technical, English, and Soft Skills run in parallel, reinforcing one
another through shared assignments and project work.
●​ Task- and Project-Based: Every module closes with an applied deliverable — from
GitHub repos to essays to presentations.
●​ Scaffolded Progression: Learners move step by step from foundations to advanced
deployment, with English and soft skills layered throughout.
●​ Active Practice: Emphasis on group work, role plays, peer feedback, and workplace-like
scenarios.
●​ Capstone-Driven: All strands converge in the Capstone, where learners demonstrate the
full stack of skills.

Integrated Soft Skills Competencies
In addition to the training workshops, soft skills are embedded in daily practice. Learners apply
professional behaviors as part of their technical and English training:
●​ Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving: debugging, evaluating trade-offs between AI
models, and analyzing AI readings to form evidence-based arguments.
●​ Professional Communication: writing emails, reports, and presentations using correct
technical and business language.
●​ Collaboration & Teamwork: working in pairs and groups, using shared GitHub workflows
and presentations that mimic professional teams.
●​ Time & Task Management: meeting assignment deadlines, managing multi-track
deliverables, and working in sprint-like cycles.
●​ Professional & Ethical Conduct: observing etiquette in shared code repos, citing sources
properly, and practicing responsible reporting.
●​ Leadership & Initiative: rotating roles (Project Manager, Documentation Lead, QA) and
leading discussions or presentations.
●​ Adaptability & Resilience: handling shifting project requirements, errors, or Q&A under
pressure.
●​ Digital Professionalism: building a GitHub portfolio with clean documentation, writing
LinkedIn summaries in professional English, and practicing digital communication etiquette.
